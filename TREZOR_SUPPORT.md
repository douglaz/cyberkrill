# Trezor Hardware Wallet Support

## Current Status: âœ… WORKING

Trezor support is fully implemented and functional using the master branch of trezor-client.

## Solution

Using the Git master branch of `trezor-client` from the official Trezor repository, which has been updated to support `bitcoin` v0.32. This resolves all type compatibility issues.

## Features

1. **Core Module** (`cyberkrill-core/src/trezor.rs`):
   - Full Trezor hardware wallet implementation
   - Address generation for BIP44/49/84 paths
   - PSBT signing functionality
   - Device initialization and info retrieval

2. **SLIP-0132 Support** (`cyberkrill-core/src/slip132.rs`):
   - Parsing of zpub/ypub/vpub/upub formats
   - Conversion to standard xpub format
   - Full test coverage

3. **CLI Integration** (`cyberkrill/src/main.rs`):
   - `trezor-address` command for address generation
   - `trezor-sign-psbt` command for transaction signing
   - Network selection support (mainnet/testnet/signet/regtest)

## Usage

```bash
# Build with Trezor support
cargo build --features trezor

# Generate address
cargo run --features trezor -- trezor-address --path "m/84'/0'/0'/0/0" --network bitcoin

# Sign PSBT
cargo run --features trezor -- trezor-sign-psbt transaction.psbt --network bitcoin
```

## Known Limitations

Even when working, the current `trezor-client` library has limitations:
- Returns SLIP-0132 format xpubs (zpub/ypub) for BIP49/84 paths
- The library internally constructs these incorrectly, causing parsing errors
- Address generation works but xpub extraction is limited for non-BIP44 paths

## Files Ready for Integration

- `cyberkrill-core/src/trezor.rs` - Main implementation
- `cyberkrill-core/src/slip132.rs` - SLIP-0132 format support
- `cyberkrill/src/main.rs` - CLI commands (lines 56-61, 215-243, 525-528, 1384-1444)
- `cyberkrill-core/src/lib.rs` - Module exports (lines 10-13, 58-63)
- `cyberkrill-core/Cargo.toml` - Feature definition (currently commented out)
- `cyberkrill/Cargo.toml` - Feature forwarding (line 14)
